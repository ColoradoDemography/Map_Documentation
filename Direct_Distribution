Three tables need to be obtained from the Oracle Sev_Distribution user.
* FML_TIER1_DISTRIBUTION
* FML_TIER1_DISTRIBUTION_SB106
* SDD_TIER1_DISTRIBUTION

Copy the data from these tables into new Excel spreadsheets named FML_TIER1_DISTRIBUTION.XLSX, SEV_DISTRIBUTION_FML_TIER1_SB1061.XLSX
and SDD_TIER1_DISTRIBUTION.XLSX respectively.

Copy the summarize_data.R script saved in K:/ProjectsMain/EIAF/Scripts to the folder with those spreadsheets, change line 92 to give the
desired name to your output csv and then run lines 70-92.
